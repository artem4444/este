###### DB container Abstract:
I am building a multi-agent system controlling pcb-designing editor-simulator.
tools i use ubuntu 24.04, vscode, langgraph agents powered by huggingface llm api, kicad 8 simulator, postgresql database, github, docker, kubernetes. 
deployment: distinct containers for simulator, agents, database. i orchestrate them with kubernetes.
CICD: github, github actions.
frontend: discord server will serve as UI: for chat and files loading. 
logic: agents will control kicad 8 pcb simulator. client_manager agent will interact with user through discord chat until it will have all the neccessary data to path to pcb_designer agent. pcb_designer will generate python file with pcbnew- python object for controlling kicad 8. kicad 8 will simulate the design. pcb_tester agent will run tests in kicad to validate the design, if something is wrong, it will return errors info to pcb_designer, for it to fix the problem in it's design. when the design is successfully tested, it will be pathed to END node, which will send it to user through frontend.


i am currently working on project from ubuntu 24, but in production it will be hosted in docker container, that will interact with other part of project through internet. 

how to structure database container? give me all files and objects regarding database i need and how they will be stored inside their container. give me instruction on how to realise database set up for my project perfectly





# PostgreSQL SSOT: database-driven state management system

put all State data in single sql:
I want to connect all entities through single sql
    *when we use ERP the real SSOT is underlying SQL: ERP is just a wrapper around it*


#### Installation and Set up: PostgreSQL = psql
###### psql query language:
SELECT: Fetch data.
INSERT: Add data.
UPDATE: Modify data.
DELETE: Remove data.
CREATE: Create database objects (e.g., tables, users).
DROP: Delete objects.

#### installation of postgresql server
/home/artem/Mosaic/hardware_mas/database/psql_server_install.sh

#### stack builder
Stack Builder is a PostgreSQL management utility that provides an easy way to install and manage additional tools, extensions, and drivers for PostgreSQL

sudo apt install postgresql-16-postgis-3


#### pgAdmin = SQL GUI

``` bash
sudo snap install pgadmin4
```

rightclick servers
register-server
name = localhost
-connection
host = localhost
port = 5432
username = my username i added from cli
password = i added with username
-save button

in psql everything can be done from pgAdmin GUI
    preferably: use cli: in production- no GUI

#### Users, DBs, permissions
postgres is superuser for psql
    not recommended to work under it

creating my own user: artem
from it- created DBs

#### PostgreSQL from python: psycopg2-binary
compatible with JSON: 
    python dicitonary automatically turns into JSON with one ine of code

#### put python dictionary into psql: 
pip install psycopg2-binary
``` python
import psycopg2
import json

# Example Python dictionary
my_dict = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Connect to PostgreSQL database
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="your_dbname",
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password",
    host="localhost",
    port="5432"
)

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cur = conn.cursor()

# Insert the dictionary into the table
cur.execute("INSERT INTO my_table (data) VALUES (%s)", [json.dumps(my_dict)])

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()

```



# DB = SSOT for system of multiple apps
apps can be located anywhere: servers, serveless architectures, mobile apps on Users' phones

# DBMS databases
1 database for 1 mas project


# DBMS users
*when i create a database, i give DBMS user with configured permissions(roles) to each app*

each app has it's own user, each user has it's set_of_permissions=role

# DB roles
database roles are a way to group and manage permissions in a database system. They act like containers for a set of permissions, which can then be granted to users. A role essentially defines a set of actions that can be performed (such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, etc.), and users assigned to that role inherit the corresponding permissions

# DB_user permissions
what actions users can perform on database objects
-typically include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
-are assigned to roles or directly to users


# DB Schema
=blueprint for the database, detailing the arrangement of tables, fields, relationships, constraints, and other elements

-written using a database's Data Definition Language (DDL), which is part of SQL in relational databases

-stored inside DB itself
    in cloud-services: in db instance itself

-runs on DB server

#### init-db.sql = Database Initialization Script
init-db.sql is typically enough for setting up your database schema on the first run. When the container starts, PostgreSQL will automatically run all the SQL commands in init-db.sql as part of its initialization process (if the script is placed in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/)

#### migration scripts (e.g., for schema updates).
Use database migration tools like Flyway, Liquibase, or Alembic (if you're using Python) to track changes over time and apply those changes incrementally to your production database.

#### Stored Procedures/Functions
If your application requires complex business logic or database-side operations (like triggers or advanced calculations), you can define them in a separate SQL script



# DB control beyond Schema: DB_CLI / python scripts
-access control
-db configuration
-data import


# Direct DB interaction: simplicity
Avoiding the API layer reduces costs in terms of development, maintenance, and additional infrastructure

no direct access to database managing logic from frintend- secure

#### dbms_user = node : for every agent from /agents
they run in same server place anyway and only interact to outside through frontend logic (discord_bot)

#### DBMS-python safe online interaction
configure firewalls to permit traffic on the PostgreSQL port (default 5432)
    connection to database is done through psycopg2 (i only use python)

SSL/TLS encryption for the database connection
    1. Psycopg2 uses libpq (the PostgreSQL C client library) for connecting to the database
    2. Libpq then establishes a secure SSL/TLS connection with the PostgreSQL server using these parameters
    3. Once the secure connection is established, all data transferred between psycopg2 and PostgreSQL, including queries and results, is encrypted at the transport layer

```python
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="your_database",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    host="your_host",
    port="5432",
    sslmode="require" #SSL encryption
)
```

# for untrustful db_clients: DB API layer: 
for Users' mobile apps, discord_bot, 
1. The App sends requests (e.g., REST or GraphQL) to an API Server.
2. The API Server processes the request, applies business logic, validates input, and interacts with the database.
3. The Database responds to the API server, which formats the response and sends it back to the app.







# current (18.12) container_psql
```bash
artem@LAPTOP-15QP4R2F:~/Mosaic/hardware_mas/psql_database$ docker build -t container_psql .

artem@LAPTOP-15QP4R2F:~/Mosaic/hardware_mas/psql_database$ docker-compose up -d

#connect to db:
docker exec -it container_psql psql -U admin -d hardware_mas

```


# how to use container_psql
docker start container_psql

*run all commands in psql cli by launchin files with schemas instead*

#### run schema in psql inside container_psql:
to execute the file `/home/artem/Mosaic/hardware_mas/psql_database/schemas/agents.sql` in your PostgreSQL container (`container_psql`), follow these steps:

**1. Copy the File into the Container**
The `agents.sql` file must be accessible inside the `container_psql` container. Use the `docker cp` command to copy the file into the container:

```bash
docker cp /home/artem/Mosaic/hardware_mas/psql_database/schemas/agents.sql container_psql:/agents.sql
```

This will copy the `agents.sql` file into the root directory of the container.

**2. Access the PostgreSQL Container**
Enter the `container_psql` container interactively:

```bash
docker exec -it container_psql bash
```

**3. Run the SQL File in `psql`**
Once inside the container, you can use the `psql` CLI to run the SQL file:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d your_database_name -f /agents.sql
```

- Replace `postgres` with the PostgreSQL user (commonly `postgres`).
- Replace `your_database_name` with the name of your target database.
- The `-f` flag tells `psql` to execute the commands in the file.


**4. Clean Up (Optional)**
After the file has been executed, you can remove the file from the container if itâ€™s no longer needed:

```bash
rm /agents.sql
```

# psql db acts as server and brocker in LISTEN/NOTIFY messaging between Nodes

###### Abstract and how to prompt:
in my project:
I am building a multi-agent system controlling pcb-designing editor-simulator.
tools i use ubuntu 24.04, vscode, langgraph agents powered by huggingface llm api, kicad 8 simulator, postgresql database, github, docker, kubernetes. 
deployment: distinct containers for simulator, agents, database. i orchestrate them with kubernetes.
CICD: github, github actions.
frontend: discord server will serve as UI: for chat and files loading. 
logic: agents(=nodes) will control kicad 8 pcb simulator. client_manager agent will interact with user through discord chat until it will have all the neccessary data to path to pcb_designer agent. pcb_designer will generate python file with pcbnew- python object for controlling kicad 8. kicad 8 will simulate the design. pcb_tester agent will run tests in kicad to validate the design, if something is wrong, it will return errors info to pcb_designer, for it to fix the problem in it's design. when the design is successfully tested, it will be pathed to END node, which will send it to user through frontend.

DB: Postgresql
regular PostgreSQL backups: out source service

communication between nodes: LISTEN/NOTIFY through Postgresql

deployment: distinct Docker containers for every part of project, running in Docker Engine controlled by K8s cluster.
if one K8s cluster won't be enough for traffic- i will add more K8s cluster's.
network of K8s clusters will be controlled with Rancher 

all containers i currently have:
1. container_mas (with most system's logic)
2. container_psql (with Postgresql DB)
3. container_rancher : orchestration tools
4. container_frontend_connect (with objects managing connection between frontend / APIs and other containers)
5. container_kicad (with running kicad8 simulator)
6. container_logging (for centralized logging)
7. container_monitoring (for performance monitoring)

how to set up LISTEN/NOTIFY functinality between Nodes through this psql db?


#### LISTEN
clients(=Nodes and other classes) connect to the PostgreSQL server and use the LISTEN command to subscribe to specific channels

#### NOTIFY
clients or database processes can send notifications using the NOTIFY command in same channel that other clients are LISTENing

channels in PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY mechanism can be bidirectional: any client connected to the database can both LISTEN to a channel and NOTIFY on the same channel

#### Node() configuration for LISTEN/NOTIFY
every Node has several channels that it constantly LISTENs and uses to send NOTIFICATIONs: these channels are coded inside Node() superclass in 'LISTEN channel_name;' line 

for different sets of LISTEN/NOTIFY channels for each Node: use class initialization parameters


Update the Node superclass to integrate with the notifications table and handle inter-agent communication.
Modifications:
Configure the listen_channel for each Node agent: Each node listens on its dedicated or shared PostgreSQL channel.
Send Notifications: Use NOTIFY to send payloads to specific channels.
Handle Incoming Notifications: Use LISTEN to process messages and update states accordingly.


#### psql messaging using from/to Nodes: each Node will:

1. Send a notification when an event occurs: first notification = call from main.py/client_manager (in README)
2. Listen for notifications, process the payload, and act on it.

each Node will have such Arguments passed when it is called: 
    LISTEN psql db channels list
    NOTIFY psql db channels list


Example of Calling the Node with Channels:
```python:
# Example: Creating a PCBDesigner Node with its listen and notify channels
pcb_designer = PCBDesigner(
    name="PCBDesigner",
    llm_provider_name="HuggingFace",
    db_query="SELECT * FROM designs WHERE status='pending';",
    listen_channels=["task_queue", "design_updates"],  # Listen to task and design updates channels
    notify_channels=["design_completed", "corrections_needed"]  # Notify others about design completion and corrections
)

# To send a notification to a channel:
pcb_designer.send_notification("design_completed", "Design process has finished successfully!")

# To listen for incoming notifications
pcb_designer.listen_for_notifications()

```

#### send_notification from function of a Node in specific channel 









# messages storing in psql db
where messages will go after time:
*Messages are ephemeral*
in a PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY messaging system, messages sent via the NOTIFY command are delivered to any session that is actively listening on the corresponding channel using the LISTEN command. Once a message is delivered, it is processed by the listener(s) but does not persist in the PostgreSQL database


#### to save messages in psql db: save in table before sending
1. create a table in psql db specifically for storing notifications
2. modify your Node() send_notification method to insert the message into the notifications table, so it is saved in the database before being sent as a notification
